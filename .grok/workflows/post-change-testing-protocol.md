# Post-change testing (narrative)

Executable source of truth: `.grok/skills/post-change-accuracy-protocol/SKILL.md`.

1. Targeted unit + coverage + lint/typecheck (fix→re-test, max 3 cycles)  
2. `/review` (or SKIPPED per implement de-dupe) + security pass when diff touches auth/secrets/payments/untrusted input  
3. Regression (fix→re-test, max 3 cycles)  
4. UI verification when UI surfaces changed (design blockers = gaps; observable evidence or `NO UI TOOLING`)  
5. `/check-work`  
6. Lead merge decision + waivers  

Full protocol may repeat up to **3** times on failure, then escalate.
